### Q1~Q3

B，Because a satisfiable class must have a non-empty interpretation, but is not **always** have a non-empty interpretation in any time.

B，Because  a unsatisfiable class $A$ w.r.t. $O$ must have all model $I$ of $O$ with $A^I= \{\}$.

A，Because a unsatisfiable class $A$ w.r.t. $O$  means for all model $I$ of $O$ , $A^I=\{\}$，and empty set is subclass of any other classes.

### Q4

+ Competency Questions are some questions that help capture scope, content and a form of evaluation. For example, if we have a pizza ontology, we can ask "Does this pizza contain halal meat?". CQs play an important role in the ontology development, it means what should the ontology be competent to answer, they gives the specification of requirements. if we can answer CQ then the ontology is OK, otherwise, the ontology needs to be adjust according to our requirements.
+ I will use them reasonably to meet the development requirements of my ontology. During the process of ontology development (assuming I'm operating protege), everytime when I complete a phase of work, I would ask whether ontology meets some requirements based on the existing axiom. For example, if I'm developing a sushi ontology, I wll ask "Which sushi is spicy?".

### Q5

+ I think existential restriction in ontology would be preferable. Because in many cases existential restriction are common, and only restriction cases are relatively rare. For example, a sushi can have some rice, but obviously it will not have only rice. Moreover, in the development process of the ontology, it is sometimes difficult to judge whether the restriction of a class is only, such as a pizza hastype some spicy, in the later development process, it may have other types but rightnow we just do not know. And only means if it has something, then something must be the specific thing, but it is possible that it doesn't have the thing.
